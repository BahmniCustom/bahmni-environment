Convention

variable_name
file-name.pp

No wget. Provisioning should work in low resource scenarios.
Make sure the resource definitions have checks so that when run again they are fast and leave the system in correct state
Class with arguments only if we would declare more than one of those resources.
Use the order of definition to express the order of execution, "require" is really not required.

Read puppet documentation. Good one here. http://docs.puppetlabs.com/learning/
Discuss with the team if you disagree.

Technical debt
--------------
1. We have a pattern - create a shell script using a template file and then execute the same script. Can this be done via a single custom resource type
2. Make all the actions idempotent, i.e. do nothing if already in the state required
