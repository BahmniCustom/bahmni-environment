# Command to run vagrant provision
STAGE="deploy" vagrant provision

Stages
------
Provision
Stop Bahmni
Deploy Bahmni
Start Bahmni

Development: Deploy Bahmni on running platform

Convention (case included)
--------------------------
variable_name, resource_name, class_name
file-name.pp

Do not use wget. Provisioning should work in low/no network sites as well.
Make sure the resource definitions have checks so that when run again they are fast and leave the system in correct state
Class with arguments only if we would declare more than one of those resources.
Use the order of definition to express the order of execution, "require" is really not required.
Define the resources based on what it creates rather and what it does
Use test.pp instead of commenting includes

Technical debt
--------------
0. Enable acpi - https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Acpid
1. We have a pattern - create a shell script using a template file and then execute the same script. Can this be done via a single custom resource type
2. Make all the actions idempotent, i.e. do nothing if already in the state required
3. There are a lot of classes where we had to set path, set user, group etc. Find out if there is a way to set this in one place and get this to work.
4. All the shell scripts are currently dumped in temp dir. May be we should have sub-folders inside it as well
5. Deployment classes do not need to "require" Provision classes. Eventually we should not need this but currently we are not confident whether running same class twice would have an affect or not.
6. How to avoid running provision on vagrant reload.
7. The packaging of containing unnecessary items in it
8. Tomcat memory should be configurable
9. Need to ensure that all passwords are cleaned up after deployment/provisioning - or better not save password anywhere
10. puppet mysql/postgres replication running via puppet code
11. Refactor puppet scripts to keep all the environment specific variables in a single file (tomcat memory parameter)

Things to go in package
-----------------------
REST extension

Issues
------
all openerp module dependencies
dump on vinay's machine
missing eggs
log file sizes
git ignore test.pp
crontab email delete

remaining
---------
reports
lsyncd

The migration process didn't exit after it finished. Something to do with threads.
Both the backup failed when run from puppet

Support tasks
-------------
Printing of bills
Monitoring
Backup should stop postgres and take backup
Setup network so that subdomains, sub-nets and domain work correctly.
Network to allow ssh from outside.
Setup key based auth for machines.
Take backup of zero shell.
Finish all the reports.
Active passive deployment via command line instead of changing the files

Performance
-----------
