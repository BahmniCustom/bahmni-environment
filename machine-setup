# The order is important (for help you can use info command)

# Connect to ethernet and then bring up that interface (vagrant/vbox does this automatically)
ifup eth0

# Edit the network config file to assign IP etc. You would need to restart the network service after this. Check the samples folder. (vagrant/vbox would automatically assign an ip)
vi /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0
service network restart

# Change the name of the host to something like emr01-gan-jss, emr02-gan-jss. See the sample file below (needed only for production boxes or if one is particular about the name of machine)
vi /etc/sysconfig/network
# Sample file
NETWORKING=yes
HOSTNAME=emr01-gan-jss

# Enable/Disable caching in yum.conf file (this is not required always because the installation should happen from local machine)
vi /etc/yum.conf
keepcache=1
# sed -i 's/keepcache=1/keepcache=0/g' /etc/yum.conf

# Create epel repository - there is a file in the samples folder (not required for vagrant/vbox as the install would happen from localrepo)
vi /etc/yum.repos.d/epel.repo

# Copy local yum repository. The local yum repo contains all rpms needed by our puppet deploys, and will be added by the # puppet scripts. 
cd /etc/yum.repos.d/
# Change all .repo files with enabled=0 to enabled=1
# e.g. sed -i 's/enabled=1/enabled=0/g' /etc/yum.repos.d/CentOS-Base.repo

# Install openssh locally or as below (not required for vagrant/vbox because it comes with ssh)
yum install openssh.x86_64
# Start the ssh server
service sshd start

# Change the hosts file by putting in the host name (not required for vagrant/vbox - not particular about the name)

# Change IP tables to allow everything (vagrant/vbox doesn't block by default hence not required fot it)

# Set date-time (done via puppet now)
chkconfig ntpd on
ntpdate pool.ntp.org
service ntpd start

#Disable SELinux (done via puppet now)
vi /etc/selinux/config
ensure the following line
